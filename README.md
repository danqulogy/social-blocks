# Social Blocks

## Monorepo for my first DApp on Arc Block

- This project can be deployed on a Blocklet Server and used with only one user per an instance.
- Once a user authenticates with DID wallet, they are the sole owner.
- If deployed to a production server, you can easily map your site to the domain of your choice.

## All commands can be run from root

- Install all dependencies for server and client

```bash
yarn install
```

- Build entire project

```bash
yarn build
```

- Run backend and serve frontend build folder

```bash
yarn start
```
